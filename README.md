## List of Programs

This assignment is divided into two main sections: problems related to arrays and problems related to strings.

### üìù Array-Based Problems

1.  **Accept and Print:** Accept 5 values and print them.
2.  **Access Elements:** Accept 10 values and print the 4th, 7th, and 9th values.
3.  **Sorting:** Accept 5 values and sort the array in ascending/descending order.
4.  **Currency Denomination:** Calculate the minimum number of notes required for a given amount (denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500).
5.  **2D Array Addition:** Add two 2D arrays of the same size.
6.  **2D Array Multiplication:** Multiply two 2D arrays.
7.  **Matrix Transpose:** Obtain the transpose of a 4x4 matrix.
8.  **Array Copying:** Copy a 5-element array to another 10-element array, skipping one position.
9.  **Array Reversal:** Reverse an array of a maximum of 5 elements.
10. **Frequency Count:** Find the frequency of each number in an array of 10 elements.
11. **Array Shifting:** Shift all numbers by `n` positions within an array (left or right) and pad with 0s.
12. **Insertion (Beginning):** Insert a new number at the beginning of an array.
13. **Insertion (Specific Position):** Insert a new number at a particular position in an array.
14. **Insertion (End):** Insert a new number at the last position of an array.
15. **Deletion (Beginning):** Delete a value from the first position of an array.
16. **Deletion (Specific Position):** Delete a value from a particular position in an array.
17. **Deletion (End):** Delete a value from the last position of an array.
18. **Search and Delete:** Delete a specific value from an array after searching for it.
19. **Search:** Search for a value within an array.

### ‚úçÔ∏è String-Based Problems

1.  **String Length:** Find the length of a string.
2.  **To Lowercase:** Convert a string to lowercase.
3.  **To Uppercase:** Convert a string to uppercase.
4.  **Toggle Case:** Convert a string to toggle case (e.g., `AbCdE` ‚Üí `aBcDe`).
5.  **String Copy:** Copy one string to another.
6.  **String Comparison:** Compare two strings lexicographically.
7.  **String Reversal:** Reverse a string.
8.  **Palindrome Check:** Check whether a string is a Palindrome.
9.  **Concatenation:** Concatenate one string at the end of another.
10. **Vertical Print:** Print characters of a string vertically.
11. **Reversed Vertical Print:** Print a reversed string vertically, character by character.
12. **Vowel Frequency:** Find the frequency of each vowel in a given string.

To compile and run any of the C programs in this repository, you can use a C compiler like GCC.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the directory containing the source file
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Compile the desired C file (e.g., program1.c)
gcc program1.c -o program1

# 3. Execute the compiled program
./program1
```
